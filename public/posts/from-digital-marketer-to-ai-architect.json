    "content": "<h2>The Shift: Why I Left Traditional Marketing</h2><p>Before 2022, my world was defined by CPC, ROAS, and the endless cycle of paid traffic. As the founder of <strong>Metrohyp</strong>, I helped brands scale using data-driven digital marketing strategies. We were successful, but I saw a ceiling approaching.</p><p>The launch of OpenAI changed everything. It wasn't just a tool; it was a signal that the operational layer of business was about to be rewritten.</p><h2>The Crypto & Infrastructure Pivot</h2><p>My interest in decentralized systems began in 2020. While many were chasing memecoins, I was fascinated by the infrastructure layer. I became heavily involved in running nodes for projects like <strong>Humanode</strong>, <strong>Fizznode</strong>, and <strong>Hemi</strong>.</p><p>Running nodes taught me Linux, server management (HestiaCP, Docker), and the importance of 24/7 uptime. It was the perfect training ground for what came next.</p><h2>Algorithmic Trading & Automation</h2><p>I started trading manually in 2018. Like most, I learned the hard way that emotions kill profits. This drove me to build my first automation bots. Today, my trading infrastructure runs autonomously, generating consistent returns without me staring at charts.</p><h2>The Current Era: AI Agents</h2><p>Now, I combine all these disciplines—marketing strategy, server infrastructure, and automation logic—to build <strong>AI Agents</strong>. These aren't just chatbots; they are autonomous workers that can research, code, deploy, and manage complex workflows.</p><p>This website itself is a testament to that. It's not just a portfolio; it's a living system, deployed and managed by the very intelligence I help others build.</p>"
